========

An updated version of the GeoGame, a psychology experiment in information processing.

## What is it?

This project began as a reimplementation of the original [GeoGame](http://github.com/grapesmoker/geogame), a foraging game whose goal was to study how information propagates in networks and how that influences task performance. After spending a lot of time futzing with GWT, I decided that it might be more efficient to implement a Django/JavaScript version of the game to bypass the bloat of GWT. This is the core of that project, which fell by the wayside after our attentions were redirected elsewhere.
